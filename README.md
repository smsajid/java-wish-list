# Java Wish List
Java Community Wish List for the Java Platform

# Motivation
The Java platform is the top platform for developers to deliver the best of breed applications that has transformed the software industry like no other. It has inspired other platforms with similar design and architecture. It is under continuous transformation process to meet the demands of modern software applications. It has seen many a change in governance - from the creator Sun to current owner Oracle and part of the platform (Jakarta EE) now moved to Eclipse Foundation.

Java has also inspired many open source foundations to be created - Apache Software Foundation, Eclipse Foundation and others - for the global collaboration of software developers. These foundations has produced the top open source projects in the world - Tomcat, Hadoop, Jetty, Vert.x, Zookeeper to name a few.

Of late, there has been some slow down of innovations in the Java world and we no longer see much great innovations in terms of newly created open source that has much great appeal. Most of the current innovations is now being developed in competing platforms like Go (Kubernetes), Python (MAchine Learning), Javascript (Angular, React), etc. Maybe the copyright issue with the Core Java platform may have motiviated large companies to move away from Java. Also, with the advent of containerized world, the appeal of `Build Once, Run Anywhere` is waning at the language runtime level.

Oracle has introduced numerous initiatives to kickstart a new revolution in the Java world - most notably the donation of Java EE to Eclipse Foundation as Jakarta EE and the creation of the Graal framework. The Graal framework provides great competition to other compiled languages like Go, bringing a unique combination of VM or binary mode of delivery.

These key developments should inspire all Java developers to start innovating again on the Java platform as outer space is no longer the limit (It is already on Mars!).

This repository is created to list down the wish list of applications, frameworks, libraries that should be available/improved on the Java platform. This list will motivate the the maintainers of various open source projects to improve their products ot inspire people to create new projects to fulfil the wish list!
